# BeethovenProject

Project members: David Tran, Vivian Tran, Dean Dirk Schlingmann of the University of South Carolina Upstate.

The purpose of this project was to use Mathematica to algorithmically manipulate Beethoven's _Pathetique_ and statistically analyze musical data. This project was started in the Fall of 2014 and completed in the Spring of 2015.

At the completion of the project, our report was published in the USC Upstate Research Symposium Volume and a presentation was given at the research symposium event.
